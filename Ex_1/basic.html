            <h2>Why are we here?</h2>
            <p>
                You might be thinking that programming is <strong>SUPER COMPLEX</strong>, filled with <i>cryptic code</i> 
                that only wizards can understand, but it's really just like being the chef in a 
                <u>very particular restaurant</u>. You give the computer step-by-step instructions <sub>(the recipe)</sub>, 
                and it cooks up whatever you want, as long as your instructions are crystal clear and don't involve 
                any <strong>"a pinch of this, a dash of that"</strong> ambiguity.
                And if your program doesn't work, it's probably because you accidentally told the computer to put 
                pineapple on the pizza. Again. Don't worry, even seasoned chefs burn the occasional dish.

            <h2>Want a roadmap?</h2>
            <p>
                A "roadmap" is a high-level strategic document that outlines the vision, goals, key initiatives, and 
                planned direction of a product or project over a specific timeframe. Think of it like a GPS for your 
                coding adventure, showing you the major cities and milestones you'll hit, rather than every single street and turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is one of the most popular roadmap websites: 
                <a href="https://roadmap.sh/" target="_blank">Roadmap.sh</a>
            </p>

            <h2>How to plan our programming path?</h2>
            <p>
                You don't need a clear path at the beginning. Just <strong>START</strong> with a small idea or project. Learn through it, copy-paste code—it's fine—but understand each line. 
                Ask questions, even on simple things. It deepens understanding and clears your thinking. 
                Avoid jumping from one tutorial to another—that's a common mistake (even I did it).
            </p>

            <p>Let’s check one of the fields I’m familiar with:</p>

                <li>Basic Requirements
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML</li>
                        <li>CSS</li>
                        <li>JavaScript</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Later
                    <ul>
                        <li>React.js (Frontend)</li>
                        <li>Express.js (Backend)</li>
                        <li>MongoDB (Database)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                With this, you'll complete the basics. You can later explore networking, authentication, state management, and more.
                It may feel overwhelming at first—BUT trust me, IT'S WORTH IT.
